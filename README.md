# w4g_ratingbar

This project is based on the orignal work of David and Franck Dernoncourt for wiki 4 games, it displays a rating bar on a wiki page that the user can use to rate something from 1 - 100.

I've only tested the rating bar functionality on MW 1.27.1 probably works with 1.27, 1.26 and earlier may not work.
Tthe mmigration feature to update from rating bar v1.1 I have not tested at all, I updated so it no longer generates errors but nothing else, use at your own risk.
